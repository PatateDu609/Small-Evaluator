This is a small arithmetic evaluator (it is only handling additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions, modulos and exponentiations). I implemented it using C++98 and no library.

The main class (the Evaluator class) is interpreting each number in the expression as a fixed point number. These numbers are represented by the class Fixed.
